Renewable Energy Forecasting
This project focuses on the local forecasting of renewable energy sources using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to develop and evaluate various machine learning models to accurately predict renewable power generation. Accurate forecasting is crucial for maintaining grid stability, managing resources efficiently, and optimizing energy markets.
Features
 * Diverse Model Evaluation: The notebook explores and compares the performance of several regression models, including traditional methods like Linear Regression and Random Forest, as well as advanced deep learning architectures such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
 * Comprehensive Data Handling: The project includes detailed steps for data analysis, preprocessing (handling missing values), and feature engineering to prepare the data for model training.
 * Performance Metrics: Model performance is rigorously evaluated using standard metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
 * Visualization: The notebook provides visualizations, including scatter plots comparing predicted versus actual values, to visually support the findings of the model evaluations.
Getting Started
This project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook (local forecasting of renewable energy.ipynb), which can be executed in a local environment or a cloud-based platform like Google Colab.
Prerequisites
 * Python 3.x
 * Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
 * Kaggle API key (for downloading the dataset)
Installation
The notebook handles the installation of all necessary libraries, primarily through the use of pip install. The key dependencies include kaggle, pandas, and other libraries required for the various machine learning models.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. The notebook automatically downloads and unzips the dataset from the specified Kaggle repository upon execution.
Usage
 * Clone the Repository: Clone this project to your local machine.
 * Open the Notebook: Open the local forecasting of renewable energy.ipynb file in your preferred Jupyter environment.
 * Configure Kaggle API: Follow the instructions within the notebook to set up your Kaggle API credentials. This step is necessary to download the dataset.
 * Execute Cells: Run the cells sequentially to perform data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
 * Analyze Results: Review the output of the notebook, including the performance metrics and visualizations, to understand the effectiveness of each model.
Conclusion
The analysis within the notebook demonstrates that the Random Forest Regressor consistently performs best across all evaluation metrics, with the lowest MAE and MSE and the highest R2 score. The scatter plots further confirm that its predictions align most closely with the actual power generation values. This makes the Random Forest Regressor the recommended model for real-world deployment in this context. Further steps could involve hyperparameter tuning to potentially enhance its performance.
